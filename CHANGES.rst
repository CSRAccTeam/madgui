First reference point to define somewhat stable versions.

List of features:

- cpymad/pytao as simulation backends

- plots: alfa/beta/envelope/orbit; and the ones defined by tao

- integrated python shell (ipython/jupyter) not very useful as of yet:
        * limited exhibition of objects
        * no convenient APIs provided (plotting)

- log tab that shows madx/tao output

- tab that shows madx/tao commands

- display and edit box for
        * beam parameters
        * initial conditions (i.e. twiss)
        * element attributes (read-only)

- 2D floor plan

- matching (interactive + dialog)

- emittance (dialog)

- orbit alignment: 2-grid + N+optic methods
